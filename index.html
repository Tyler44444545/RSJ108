Make your own step-by-step guide
================================

This template allows you to build a more advanced step-by-step guide.
The example theme here is for you to change as much as you like to
create appearance and content which are truly your own.

READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of
this for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but
instead are just text comments about the code. For this project, the
comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing
the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding
of what you are being asked to do.

GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like
this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information
contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side
of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

IN THIS CHALLENGE, YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT:

- HTML: Nested lists
- HTML: Unordered list
- HTML: Captions
- CSS: Borders
- CSS: Embedding images and videos

              <h3>Identify a target customer.</h3>
              <p>Your business or product may appeal to a broad range of consumers, but for the purposes of advertising, it is usually helpful to think only about a specific subset of this potential audience. A single ad cannot appeal to or target every single person - accept this and then consider which consumers are most important for this project. For example:
If you are creating an advertisement for a baby stroller, the audience is more likely going to be new moms than people who don't even have a baby.
If you are creating an advertisement for a graphics card, your audience probably knows enough about computers to realize that they can upgrade their old graphics card.</p>

  <!-- A new step -->
          <li>
            <div class="content">
              <h3>Describe your target customer.</h3>
              <p>The more descriptive your team can be here, the more targeted and effective your ad will be. Imagine your target customer in your mind's eye, and ask yourself the following questions:
What approximate age or gender are they?
Do they live in a major city or a more rural setting?
What is their income range? Are they wealthy CEOs or college students on a budget?
What other products do they use or enjoy? Do they use other products made by your company? </p>
          </li>
          <!-- A new step -->
          <li>
            <div class="content">
              <h3>Describe the target customer's relationship to your product.</h3>
              <p>Once you've described your target consumer's basic lifestyle and demographic information, now consider how that person interacts with your specific product.Consider the following:
When will they use it? Will they use it immediately, or when they need it?
How often will they use your product? Once? Daily? Weekly?
Will they immediately recognize its benefits/functions or will you have to teach them?</p>

              <h3>Identitfy the Competition.</h3>
              <p>You have hopefully already designed your product with the competition in mind. You should now consider how your ad might specifically challenge (or complement) your competition's advertising efforts and how they might react to your advertising actions.
Ask yourself: do other products exist besides yours that perform similar functions? If so, focus on the differences, especially how your product exceeds the competitor's.

              <p>Consider how your product is currently positioned. Is it a hot and popular item right now? If so, ask yourself if and how you can distinguish your product from what is already available on the market. You should also consider the competitive landscape and the customers who are currently in play. Ask yourself the following:
Do customers recognize/trust your brand already?
Are you hoping to convert people currently using the competition's product?
Will you target those without a current solution? If your product the only one like this?
